# Ploopy Adept

I'm using this more as a standalone input device so it doesn't leverage my user files.

Features:
- Momentary Drag scroll for mouse wheel emulation
- Momentary Sniper for precision cursor movements
- Allows a different DPI to be selected for these alt-modes
- Can easily enter bootloader without hardware actions
- Can easily change DPI on the fly where the default keymap doesn't include the
key binds for this

Implementation:
- The alt-modes are enabled via layer state changes
